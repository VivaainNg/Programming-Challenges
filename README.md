# Programming-Challenges
Repo containing my solutions for several programming challenges sites (i.e: Advent of Code, Project Euler, etc...)

# Preamble
For Python, you'd definitely wanna use a virtual env/venv. It's not required to run the code/tests, it's only for running pre-commit. At the root of this repo, simply run
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## TODOs:

- [x] Add pre-commit config for Python.

- [x] Add unit test for each problems.
